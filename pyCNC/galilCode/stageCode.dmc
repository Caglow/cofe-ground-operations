  NO The galil manual is incorrect in some of the code specifications.
  NO for one, it states that you must strip leading spaces from programs
  NO this is incorrect.

  NO Empty lines are a problem, though. The galil software automtically sticks
  NO a comment symbol in them (" ' ")
  NO This is easy enough to do myself.

  NO Apparently any line cannot be more then 80 characters long, though
