TelescopeControl
================

Code for controlling Galil microcontroller based telescopes

The main program is in main.py, and it can be run by entering 'python main.py' in a terminal on Linux or Mac OS X, and by simply double clicking if on Windows. Make sure that you have python 2.7, pyephem, and wxpython version 2.8 installed before trying to run, or you will get an error (possibly errorS!)

the galilinteface folder is the home of the improved code for interfacing with the galil, which will include many improvements over the existing gall.py module. Stay tuned!
